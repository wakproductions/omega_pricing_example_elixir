## Setup Notes for This App

Elixir and Mix installed on my system. To get Phoenix into the project needed to install the Phoenix module into
Mix via command: `mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phoenix_new.ez`

Upgraded barebones Elixir project to Phoenix project:

```
telnyx_omega_pricing (master)$ mix phoenix.new .
